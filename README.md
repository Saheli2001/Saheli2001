Yo, I’m Saheli! 

Survived (and secretly enjoyed :P) an MSTAT degree. I love coding and asking questions until you get annoyed. I also love exploring new research areas in vision , deep learning theory, machine learning and new starbucks coffee. Isn't it interesting how stats and maths builds the core of the most advance AI techs? Btw, my GitHub is a lab notebook + playground + battlefield — coursework, research, and side quests all mashed up. Feel free to explore!
